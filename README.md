# Magnetic-levitation-modeling-and-control

Project held at the Politecnico di Milano in the exam "Auotomation and Control Laboratory" held by prof. Cazzulani.

Main steps of the project:

1. White-box system identification of the Inteco Maglev (https://www.inteco.com.pl/products/magnetic-levitation-systems/)
2. Noise characterization
3. Control design (PID, Cascade, Pole-Placement, LQR)
4. Observer design (Luenberger, Extended Kalman Filter)
5. Results Analysis


PID Result:
